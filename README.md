# This is part of my PHD project, creating a hybrid Quantum Computational Platform
## Not completet yet
This project consists of different QAOA simulations based on Qiskit, using a GPU and, in the future FPGA
Also, QAOA parameter optimisation would be considered to explore by using different approaches, such as Bayesian optimisation

## How to install 

Creating a virtual environment as some libraries require specific version and could lead to dependency conflict 
```
python -m venv qokit
source qokit/bin/activate
pip install -U pip
```

Then, need to clone the repository 
```
git clone https://github.com/amiraliz93/QAOAHP.git
cd main/
pip install -e
Or  if you are using GitHub Desktop, use this:
https://github.com/amiraliz93/QAOAHP.git
```
